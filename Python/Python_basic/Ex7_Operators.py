#* Python Arithmetic Operators
#Addition	        x + y	
#Subtraction	    x - y	
#Multiplication	    x * y	
#Division	        x / y	
#Modulus	        x % y	
#Exponentiation	    x ** y	
#Floor division	    x // y

#* Python Assignment Operators
# x = 5	    x = 5	
# x += 3	x = x + 3	
# x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# x &= 3	x = x & 3	
# x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
# x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# x <<= 3	x = x << 3

#* Python Comparison Operators
# Equal	x == y	
# Not equal	x != y	
# Greater than	x > y	
# Less than	x < y	
# Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# Less than or equal to	x <= y

#* Python Logical Operators
# and 	    x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or		x < 5 or x < 4	
# not		not(x < 5 and x < 10)

#* Python Identity Operators
# is 	    Returns True if both variables are the same object	    x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

#* Python Membership Operators
# in 	    Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	    x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

#* Python Bitwise Operators
# & 	AND	                    Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# |	    OR	                    Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^	    XOR	                    Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ 	NOT	                    Inverts all the bits
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >>	Signed right shift	    Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
